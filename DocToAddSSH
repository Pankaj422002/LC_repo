# Using SSH

1. Generate an SSH key (if you haven't already):

  ===> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

Follow the prompts and save the key in the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).

2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:

  ===> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Go to GitHub SSH settings.

3. Add a new SSH key and paste the contents of the public key.
4. Switch your Git remote to SSH:

  ===> git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Pankaj422002/LC_repo.git

5. Push your code:

  ===> git push origin master
